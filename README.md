Welcome to my Travel web application! This is a demo app that I created using Sinatra and ActiveRecord. This app enables a user to create a profile with a profile picture, a name, email address, and bio. The user can then create posts showcasing their travels by sharing a picture with a title and a caption. Users can view other users' posts and edit and delete their own posts after logging in to their account. 

Instructions for usage:
- clone this repository
- run bundle install in your console
- run shotgun
- open your favorite browser and enter the given local url provided by the shotgun server
